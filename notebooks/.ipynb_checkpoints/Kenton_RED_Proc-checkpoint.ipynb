I was then a young pop music critic at The Washington Post , so it fell to me to write a profile of the notoriously hard- drinking singer . < /P > < P > What followed was an experience so intense , so remarkable for its raw emotional force , that I could not help but think of it Friday , when it was announced that Jones had died in a Nashville , Tenn. , hospital at the age of 81 . That weekend I learned two important things about Jones : that there was very little distance between him and his songs , and that the same qualities that made him a great artist also made his life a torment . < /P > < P > In those days he was still unashamedly carrying a torch for Wynette , who had left him because , as she put it in legal papers she filed , he “ drinks to such an extent that he becomes completely and absolutely unmanageable . ” On stage that weekend , he reworked songs like “ She Thinks I Still Care ” and “ Picture Me Without You ” so that they included references to her , making them almost embarrassingly personal , as if she were in the audience and he was singing only to her . < /P > < P > But it was on his tour bus between sets that I saw George Jones more achingly and nakedly vulnerable than any performer I have ever encountered , before or since that night . He was dressed in a flashy leisure suit and wore a pair of glittering diamond rings on his left hand , including one with his initials , but as he talked about Wynette and how much he still loved her , he began to weep . < /P > < P > I do n’t think he was drunk . He talked about how he was trying to stay dry for Tammy , who by that time had already re - married and divorced again . Within a year or two , he would develop a cocaine habit that would send his career off the rails , but there was no sign of that either . This was just George Jones in real life and real time . < /P > < P > It is hard today , in a time when irony has become a dominant cultural mode and artists are screened from reporters by phalanxes of handlers , to imagine so public a breakdown happening or a celebrity letting his pain be so visible . But Jones was n’t ashamed or embarrassed by that display , and when he went back to the stage for a second set of what he described to me as “ sad , sloppy tear - jerkers , ” his singing was even more passionate and inspired , with his twangy , somewhat nasal voice cracking in all the right places with what had to be genuine feeling , not artifice . < /P > < P > Over a career that lasted nearly 60 years , Jones recorded more than 100 albums , and over and over again , he did n’t just sing the songs that were given to him . In the best of his recordings , as on that night , he also inhabited them , so that anyone listening to him could be sure : He really means it , he has really lived this song about heartbreak or hangovers and knows what it means , poor soul . < /P > < P > As someone who grew up in Chicago listening mostly to the blues , I had no special fondness for country music , whose only local outlet in those days was the radio station WJJD . But seeing George Jones live for the first time that cold night in southern Maryland was a revelation , because in his own highly idiosyncratic way he showed himself to be no less soulful a singer than Howlin ’ Wolf on something like “ How Many More Years ” or Otis Redding on “ I ’ve Been Loving You Too Long . ” < /P > < P > Despite all the drinking and drug binges that would dog his career , Jones never lost that gift . In 2009 , assigned to write a profile of the Canadian singer- songwriter Leonard Cohen for this newspaper , I walked into Cohen ’s New York hotel suite to find him playing one of Jones ’ late - career gems , “ Choices , ” on his iPod . Cohen expressed great admiration for Jones and then recited one of the song ’s most powerful verses : < /P > < P > I was tempted < /P > < P > By an early age I found < /P > < P > I liked drinkin ’ < /P > < P > Oh , and I never turned it down < /P > < P > There were loved ones < /P > < P > But I turned them all away < /P > < P > Now I ’ m living and dying < /P > < P > With the choices I made < /P > < P > @In part because of his consistent “ nipping , ” as he called it , Jones never enjoyed the crossover success of his contemporaries Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard , and so his passing will probably not have the broad cultural resonance that Cash ’s did . But he was , hands down , a superior singer , a fact obvious to everyone in the country music field : As Waylon Jennings once sang , “ If we all could sound like we wanted to , we ’d all sound like George Jones . ” < /P > < P > But even within the confines of “ pure country , ” whatever that term might mean today , Jones did not stand still . He began his career very much in the mold of his idol Hank Williams , singing tunes about honky - tonks and carousing . He never lost his affection for that genre , but over the years he also evolved into a master of ballad singing , especially on his duets with Melba Montgomery and Wynette , both before and after they were married . < /P > < P > And though a brief late ‘ 50s flirtation with rockabilly did n’t pan out , Jones also knew how to rock . It ’s almost forgotten now , but he and Elvis Presley once were co - headliners on a Louisiana Hayride tour , and generations of rock ' n ’ roll bands , including ones I played in , have covered songs like “ Why Baby Why , ” “ White Lightning ” and “ The Race Is On ” and found them to be guaranteed crowd- pleasers . < /P > < P > Beginning in the 1980s , Jones , with the help of his fourth wife , Nancy Sepulvedo , pulled himself out of his tailspin . But by then the country music mainstream had begun to move on to more polished styles , and Jones ’ visceral approach fell out of fashion . In recent years , Jones had thought of himself as a relic , and expressed bitterness at what he saw as the disregard for what he represented . All that may be true , but it ca n’t – and does n’t – dim the magnificence of his achievements , any more than his personal weaknesses and demons did . < /P > < /TEXT > < /DOC >\n"
